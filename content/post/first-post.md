*I am very lonely, and this causes me a lot of pain.* That's about all of the unironic confessional writing you're getting out of me. Like many personal feelings, loneliness is sad but not special. If you somehow managed to stumble across this blog, I'm sure you're already aware of the ongoing "Loneliness Epidemic."[^1] We often bring it up with respect to mass violence and generational cynicism, but the implications are much broader than that.

We're talking about it more and more, but what has awareness accomplished? Crotchety boomers love to point out

Awareness raising is just myopic consciousness raising

This seems like a problem without realistic solutions. Like, what are we supposed to do? Assign government-issue friends? Participate in totalitarian "Wellness Initiatives" at our open office-standing desk jobs? Read Craigslist Missed Connections religiously? Take an improv class? Join a polycule? Start living in one of those gentrified barracks? Spend $69.99 on a mindfulness subscription and meditate so hard that your solitude becomes Good, Actually? Subsidize sex robots? Create a GoFundMe to send your widowed mother to a nursing home because the despondent look in her eyes opens a rift in your psyche so existentially harrowing that you cannot bear to confront it in the absence of a refinanceable mortgage? How about making an app that's like Uber, but for grossly underpaying "independent contractors" to smoke mids and listen to Mac DeMarco with some guy who's read *Gravity's Rainbow* and won't shut up about it?

Do you see the problem here? This goes deeper than Instagram thirst traps, Millennials with their goddamn phones, or even Living in a Society&trade;: We Live in a Neoliberal Hell, cursed by the Incorrupt relics of [Ronald Reagan](https://youtu.be/RrwUkEMmKZY). The service sector now constitutes about 80% of the [United States GDP](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/fields/214.html)[^2] &ndash; which is to say: the vast majority of our economy involves buying and selling human interaction. Not to get all Marxist here,


**Outline:**

- I am painfully lonely
- `</sincerity> <irony>`
- sad, but not special
- Folks, we've got a loneliness epidemic! More and more people are saying this!
- curmudgeons have long complained about the connected-isolated paradox
  - however, they don't recommend anything constructive
- academics will likewise point out the negative effects of heavy social media use
  - but they, too, are isolated in their respective ivory towers and may even forget their obligation as social scientists altogether
- since We Live in a Society&trade;, loneliness has far-reaching implications for:
  - political life
  - mental health
  - violent behavior
  - social welfare
  - subjective well-being
  - life outcomes
  - access to resources/opportunities
  - worker solidarity/social movements
  - The Utopian Communist Vision
  - and more!
  
- but you're probably not here for this clinical bullshit!

[^1]: I'm too lazy to dredge up data or articles anyway. In the future, I'll try to confine my ~~bullshit~~ pedantic digressions to the footnotes as much as I can.

[^2]: idk if the CIA is a trustworthy source tho
