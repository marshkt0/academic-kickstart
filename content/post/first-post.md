*I am very lonely, and this causes me a lot of pain. In my life, I've found pain to be a language of sorts. Listen, and it will speak...* 

.....which is why you're not getting any more unironic confessional writing out of me. Like many personal feelings, loneliness is sad but not special. If you somehow managed to stumble across this blog, I'm sure you're already aware of the ongoing "Loneliness Epidemic."[^1] Not to get all evo psych here, but our ability to have complex relationships with other humans is a big part of the reason we've made it this far. 

We're talking about it more and more, but what has awareness accomplished? Crotchety boomers love to point out

Awareness raising is just myopic consciousness raising

This seems like a problem without realistic solutions. Like, what are we supposed to do? Assign government-issue friends? Participate in totalitarian "Wellness Programs" at our open office-standing desk jobs? Take an improv class? Join a polycule? Start living in some kind of gentrified barracks? Start a mindfulness practice and meditate so hard that your solitude is Good, Actually? Subsidize sex robots? Create a GoFundMe to send your widowed mother to a nursing home ~~*because the despondent look in her eyes opens a rift in your psyche so existentially harrowing that you cannot bear to confront it*~~? Oh, I know: How about an app that's like Uber, except you underpay the "independent contractors" to smoke mids and listen to Mac DeMarco with some guy who's read *Gravity's Rainbow* and won't shut up about it?

I pulled these solutions out of my ass to be funny, only to discover that [others](https://www.campaigntoendloneliness.org/blog/how-can-social-prescribing-help-tackle-loneliness/) [have](https://benefitsbridge.unitedconcordia.com/protecting-employees-from-the-loneliness-epidemic/) [made](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02892006) [similar](https://medium.com/collective-living/the-loneliness-epidemic-why-we-need-co-living-c1ace9954595) [suggestions](mindfulness) [with](sex robots) [complete](https://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/29761/1/this-app-rents-out-friends-for-you-when-you-re-lonely) sincerity.[^2]

Do you see the problem here? This goes deeper than young people you don't like, technology dominating our lives, or even Living in a Society&trade;: We Live in a Neoliberal Hell, cursed by the Incorrupt relics of [Ronald Reagan.](https://youtu.be/RrwUkEMmKZY) Now that the service sector constitutes about 80% of the [United States GDP](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/fields/214.html),[^3] human interaction is just another thing we buy and sell. Interaction-as-transaction shapes our approach to the problem of loneliness. If all you get are silly answers like College Dorm 2.0, maybe you're asking all the wrong questions.

That's where my blog comes in. Will I be able to ask the right questions? Probably not &mdash; I don't even know how to read[^4] &mdash; but we need to stop allowing high-tech start-ups, op-ed columnists, Ivy League grads, Silicon Valley psychopaths, slack-jawed bureaucrats, degenerate podcasters, and "nonpartisan" think tanks to dominate the navel-gazing market. If you put a million monkeys in front of a million computers, one of them will eventually do some posts explaining why we feel so lonely or even what we can do about it.

**Outline:**

- curmudgeons have long complained about the connected-isolated paradox
  - however, they don't recommend anything constructive
- academics will likewise point out the negative effects of heavy social media use
  - but they, too, are isolated in their respective ivory towers and may even forget their obligation as social scientists altogether. and they seem to be having some trouble replicating the results of their own studies
- since We Live in a Society&trade;, loneliness has far-reaching implications for:
  - political life
  - mental health
  - violent behavior
  - social welfare
  - subjective well-being
  - life outcomes
  - access to resources/opportunities
  - worker solidarity/social movements
  - The Utopian Communist Vision
  - and more!


[^1]: The data don't seem to be clear on whether these are uniquely lonely times or that digital natives (millennials/zoomers) are exceptionally lonely people, but I'm too lazy to figure that out right now. I'll try to confine my ~~bullshit~~ pedantic digressions to the footnotes as much as I can.

[^2]: Mixed results on the polycule stuff &mdash; more on that in another post.

[^3]: Trust the CIA at your own risk.

[^4]: I have to rely on my eunuch Julian as a narrator and scribe. He really doesn't appreciate how I don't pay him and mockingly call him "Jules." Sometimes I lock Julian in the boiler room to keep him from joining a Eunuch Union, which might explain my abysmal college transcript and numerous failed relationships.
