Let's gooooo


**Outline:**

- I am painfully lonely
- `</sincerity> <irony>`
- sad, but not special
- Folks, we've got a loneliness epidemic! More and more people are saying this!
- curmudgeons have long complained about the connected-isolated paradox
  - however, they don't recommend anything constructive
- academics will likewise point out the negative effects of heavy social media use
  - but they, too, are isolated in their respective ivory towers and may even forget their obligation as social scientists altogether
- since We Live in a Society&trade;, loneliness has far-reaching implications for:
  - political life
  - mental health
  - violent behavior
  - social welfare
  - subjective well-being
  - life outcomes
  - access to resources/opportunities
  - worker solidarity/social movements
  - The Utopian Communist Vision
